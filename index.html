        <h2>1.About</h2>
        <div class="about">
App name: News Blender <br>
Goal and Vision: 21st century is the era of information and technologies. The information is such a valuable and powerful
tool that every man in power will use it and manipulate it. There is one statement for that: "Who owns information owns the world". A recent example of these words happened in 2016, the USA president election period, we saw
how the manipulated and compromised information were used very accurately, in other words <B>FAKE NEWS</B>, that influenced, to some degree, the election result. In this example, we can see how filtered information can control people's minds. Another thing that modern human needs are to be informed of everything about this person, it can be his professional news, or some hobbies or sport. For example,
news that is related to someone's work is very important for a person to be compatible professional in his field, as a programmer 
I know that technology changes rapidly every day, to keep up to date, the IT man has to regularly watch the news to see some changes,
and it can be applied to any field, today world changing so fast, so people need a source of World Wide, breaking and informative news. So with this app users can View and Share the fresh, hot breaking news from all over the world. <br>
Currently, the app provides three types of news: <br>
 (1) Bitcoin and blockchain-related news <br>
 (2) Apple products related news <br>
 (3) Finance and Stock market-related news <br>
 <br>

        <h3>Code explanation</h3> 
        <div class="explain">
            First add all the dependencies that we need for this project <br> <br>
           <img src="img/dependencies.png" alt="adding dependencies"> <br> <br>
           And of course add the internet permission in AndroidManifest.xml <br><br>
           <img src="img/int_perm.png" alt="internet permission"> <br> <br>
            To get a news i use <a href="https://newsapi.org/">newsapi</a> website. Just need to register and get your private API key. 
            I used Retrofit, a library that makes it pretty easy to send and retrieve data from a webservice. Is type-safe REST client 
            for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. <br><br>
            <br>
            Next is to create data models to parse our sample JSON data with following structure. 
            <img src="img/api.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            In total have 3 Models: <br><br>
            <img src="img/newsjava.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <img src="img/articlejava.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <img src="img/sourcejava.png" alt=""> <br> <br>

            In order to issue the network request to a REST API with Retrofit, we need to create an instance using Retrofit.Builder class 
            and configure it with a base URL. In class <B>ApiClient</B> we have BASE_URL, this is the basic URL of our API where we will make a call.
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/api_client.png" alt=""> <br>
            <br>
            In ApiInterface file, The endpoints are defined inside of an interface using special retrofit annotations to encode details about the 
            parameters and request method. <br><br>
            <img src="img/api_interface.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            <img src="img/newsapi.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            Here when we requesting a list of news we get a specific news due to our request, in this case about bitcoin, 
            and in the second GET function we are retrieving from all source news when we search by some keyword. <br>
            In MainActivity file have enqueue() function, this function asynchronously sends the request and notifies the app with a callback 
            when a response comes back. Since this request is asynchronous, Retrofit handles it on a background thread so that the 
            main UI thread isn't blocked or interfered with. To use the enqueue() function need to implement two other functions: <br>
            <B>onResponse</B> and <B>onFailure()</B> <br><br>
            Then we need an Adapter for binding data with RecycleView. <br><br>
            Then i implemented custom Floating Action Button to switch between the news articles, here i demonstrate only important code snippet for that <br><br>
            <img src="img/fab.png" alt=""> <br>
            <br>
            This function resides within <B>onCreate()</B> method body. <br>
            And i also implemented a quick tutorial for a new users, basically using flag it detects whether the app launched for the first time, if yes, it starts the tutorial.
            For that i used <a href="https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView">this library</a> to implement that. <br>
            This piece of code responsible for that: <br> <br>
            <img src="img/tutorial.png" alt=""> <br> <br>

            Before running the app, please register in <a href="https://newsapi.org/">newsapi website</a> and get your own private API key 
            and paste it in these 3 files:  <br> <br>
            <img src="img/path.png" alt=""> <br> <br> 
            <img src="img/paste_api.png" alt=""> <br> <br>
            The <B>Share</B> function is a bit poor, was planning to add share via Wechat platform, in the "Moments" and between friends, but faced 
            a problem such as the need to register on the Tencent platform as a verified organization to get the rights to add this functionality within my application.    
            Also, the app needs a stable internet connection and VPN in some cases.<br> <br>
