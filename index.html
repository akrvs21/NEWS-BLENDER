        <div class="about">
App name: News Blender <br>
Goal and Vision: 21st century is the era of information and technologies. The information is such a valueble and powerfull
tool that every man in power will use it and manipulate it. There is one statement for that: "Who owns information owns 
the world". The recent and very similar example of these words are happend in 2016, USA presedent election period, we saw
how the manipuated and compromated information were used very accurately, in other words FAKE NEWS, that influenced the 
election result and let the whole world to meet the new thread of 21st century, FAKE NEWS. The other side of valueble 
information is the value that it gives us, every tech professional, or other industry professional, have to know the
latest news from their own field to be compatible individuals to stay tuned to the latest and trending technologies 
(here i referer to and emphisize tech industry because it's my field and this app is mostly about tech news). Or it can be 
some hobbies or that people interested with and want to catch up with the latest updates. <br>
So the goal is to create an app that fulfill the requirenments of the modern human. With this app  users are able
to View and Share the fresh, hot breaking news from all over the world. <br>
Currently app provide three type of news: <br>
 (1) Bitcoin and blockchain related news <br>
 (2) Apple products related news <br>
 (3) Finance and Stock market related news <br>

        <h3>Code explanation</h3>
        <div>
            First add all the dependencies that we need for this project <br>
           <img src="img/dependencies.png" alt="adding dependencies"> <br>
           And of course add the internet permission in AndroidManifest.xml <br>
           <img src="img/int_perm.png" alt="internet permission"> <br>
            To get a news i use <a href="https://newsapi.org/">newsapi</a> website. Just need to register and get your private API key. 
            I used Retrofit, a library that makes it pretty easy to send and retrieve data from a webservice. Is type-safe REST client 
            for Android and Java which aims to make it easier to consume RESTful web services. <br>
            <br>
            Next is to create data models to parse our sample JSON data with following structure. 
            <img src="img/api.png" alt=""> <br>
            In total have 3 Models: <br>
            <img src="img/newsjava.png" alt=""> <br>
            <img src="img/articlejava.png" alt=""> <br>
            <img src="img/sourcejava.png" alt=""> <br>

            In order to issue the network request to a REST API with REtrofit, we need to create an instance using Retrofit.Builder class 
            and configureit with a base URL. In class <B>ApiClient</B> we have BASE_URL, this is the basic URL of our API where we will make a call.
            <br>
            <img src="img/api_client.png" alt="">
            <br>
            In ApiInterface file, The endpoints are defined inside of an interface using special retrofit annotations to encode details about the 
            parameters and request method. <br>
            <img src="img/api_interface.png" alt=""> <br>
            <img src="img/newsapi.png" alt=""> <br>
            Here when we requesting a list of news we get a specific news due to our request, in this case about bitcoin, 
            and in the second GET function we are retrieving from all source news when we search by some keyword. <br>
            In MainActivity file have enqueue() function, this function asynchronously sends the request and notifies the app with a callback 
            when a response comes back. Since this request is asynchronous, Retrofit handles it on a background thread so that the 
            main UI thread isn't blocked or interfered with. To use the enqueue() function need to implement two other functions: <br>
            <B>onResponse</B> and <B>onFailure()</B> <br>
            Then we need an Adapter for binding data with RecycleView. <br>
            Then i implemented custom Floating Action Button to switch between the news articles, here i demonstrate only important code snippet for that <br>
            <img src="img/fab.png" alt="">
            <br>
            This function resides within <B>onCreate()</B> method body. <br>
            And i also implemented a quick tutorial for a new users, basically using flag it detects whether the app launched for the first time, if yes, it starts the tutorial.
            For that i used <a href="https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView">this library</a> to implement that. <br>
            This piece of code responsible for that: <br>
